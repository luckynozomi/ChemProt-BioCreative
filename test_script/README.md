First, make sure all the steps in `../raw_data_processing` have been run.

Then, run the shell script `pre_steps.sh`. It copies the sentence splitter from `../raw_data_processing` and the test data.

After a model is run, get its predicted relations in a tsv file, similar to the file given by the orgainzers: `test_data/drugprot_test_relations.tsv`

Then run `python test.py [path_to_your_tsv]`, and the outputs are:
* Micro-averaged F1 score
* confusion matrix: `confusion_matrix_[your_file_name].csv`
* `whole_results.csv`, containing the real and predicted labels for every entity pair used in evaluation.

**NOTE**: whenever your `test_data` directory is changed, make sure to remove `true_standard.tsv`. It need to be re-generated by the code again.
